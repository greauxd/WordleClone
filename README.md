# WordleClone
This is a clone of the popular online game Wordle, the big difference of this game however, is it is not limited to one word per day!

Users get the standard six tries at a word, if they guess the word right or run out of tries, they are prompted to try again and get a new word!

The words are five letters long. The game will show the user if the letter is in the right spot, or if it is in the word at all!
